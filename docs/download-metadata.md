# Metadata Retrieve

This page allows users to retrieve metadata from a Salesforce organization. It provides a user-friendly interface to select and download specific metadata components.

## Features

### 1. Metadata Retrieval

* View available metadata components, excluding `InstalledPackage`.
* Sort metadata components for easier selection (by Name or LastModifiedDate option).
* Download retrieved metadata as a ZIP file.

### 2. Package.xml Generation

* Generate a `package.xml` file from selected metadata components.
* Import an existing `package.xml` file.
* Paste `package.xml` content for metadata retrieval.
* Copy or download the generated `package.xml` file.

### 3. Deployment Request Processing

* Retrieve metadata components from a specific `deployRequestId`.
* Automatically group and sort metadata components.
* Generate a `package.xml` file based on the deployment request.

### 4. Metadata Deployment

* Deploy metadata components directly from a ZIP file.
* Import and deploy package ZIP files containing metadata.
* View deployment status and results in real-time.
* Access deployment error details with direct links to Salesforce deployment status page.

### 5. Filtering and Selection Options

* Search metadata components using a filter input.
* Select all or deselect all metadata components.
* Expand/collapse metadata categories.
* Choose whether to include managed package metadata.

### 6. User Experience Enhancements

* Displays user and organization information.
* Provides real-time status updates for metadata retrieval.
* Shows logs for debugging errors.

## Options Available

* **Include Managed Packages:** Choose whether to include metadata from managed packages.
* **Metadata Filtering:** Use a search filter to find specific metadata components.
* **Legacy Version Support:** Users can opt to use a legacy version of metadata retrieval if needed.

## Deployment Options Configuration

When deploying metadata, you can configure the following options:

### Boolean Options
* **Allow Missing Files:** When enabled, allows deployment to succeed even if files specified in the package.xml are missing.
* **Check Only:** When enabled, validates the deployment without making any changes to the organization.
* **Ignore Warnings:** When enabled, allows deployment to succeed even if there are warnings.
* **Purge On Delete:** When enabled, removes deleted components from the organization.
* **Single Package:** When enabled, treats the deployment as a single package.
* **Perform Retrieve:** When enabled, performs a retrieve operation before deployment.
* **Rollback On Error:** When enabled, rolls back the deployment if an error occurs.

### Test Level Options
* **No Test Run:** No tests are run. This is the default for development environments.
* **Run Specified Tests:** Only runs the tests specified in the runTests option. Requires 75% code coverage for each class and trigger.
* **Run Local Tests:** Runs all tests in your org except those from installed managed and unlocked packages. This is the default for production deployments.
* **Run All Tests In Org:** Runs all tests in your org, including tests from managed packages.

## Generating Package.xml from Deployment Request

To generate a `package.xml` from a `deployRequestId`, the system:

1. Fetches deployment components using the Salesforce REST API.
2. Groups components by metadata type.
3. Constructs a `package.xml` file.
4. Allows users to download or use the generated file for retrieval.

## Deploying Metadata

To deploy metadata to a Salesforce organization:

1. Click the upload button to select a ZIP file containing metadata components.
2. The system will automatically process the ZIP file and initiate deployment.
3. Monitor the deployment status through the interface.
4. View detailed deployment results, including any errors or warnings.
5. Access the Salesforce deployment status page directly for more detailed information.

## Conclusion

The Metadata Retrieval page provides a streamlined way to extract metadata from Salesforce, whether through manual selection or deployment requests. Users can customize their retrieval process with filtering and managed package options while ensuring they have the necessary metadata for their deployments.
